# 🔐Sign-up-Form

This project is a hands-on exercise designed to apply the HTML and CSS concepts learned. The goal is to build a sign-up form for an imaginary service, with a focus on structure, layout, and styling — not functionality.

## 📝Overviev
I created a multi-section web page featuring:
1. A visually engaging background
2. A logo and form sidebar
3. A styled form with validation feedback


This project helped me practice:
1. Semantic HTML structure
2. CSS layout techniques
3. Pseudo-class selectors (:focus, :invalid)
4. Working with images and fonts
